# stockprofitlossmark14
This is a Web App made in VanillaJS to check the profit and loss of your stock.

Functionality:

User will enter the Purchased Price of Stock, Purchased Quantity and the Current Price of Stock.

Then whether they have made Profit or Loss will be displayed with amount in Absolute Value and in Percentage.


Future Plan : 
I have a plan to add a feature in which an API will be used to check current price of a stock instead of asking user to enter it.
